For this one, I had a few ideas about the type of song you would want to add to the song. For example, if you want to add a
song to a happy playlist that is one option, but you could have more than one happy playlist. The same goes for a playlist
of sad songs. In the top left I made it where you can choose what type of happy or song songs you want. I added the LED to
be a clarification that whatever option you choose the result would be the type of mood the song is. I then did a similar
thing for whether you want a public or private playlist, but there could be multiple types of a public playlist. I simplified
it all down to a X-Or gate. One half is you want to add a song to the playlist, and the other is you do not want to add it to
a playlist.

I also tried to use a multiplier to see if I could find a way to add multiple songs. It does work but it is not as fluid.
It is harder to tell if what you did worked because it just displays a number above the wires which are difficult to see.
You have to input 1 bit for all the inputs you want on. Once you do that you can pick how many songs you want to add by 
changing the input of the “add multiple songs” input.
