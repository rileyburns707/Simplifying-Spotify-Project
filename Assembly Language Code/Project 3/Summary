For this last one, I wanted to figure out how to incorporate the user input. This specific code determines
the type of music you want to listen to. Whether you want hip hop or folk, slow or fast, and English or Spanish.
Since I did a lot of asking the same questions I was able to recycle the same kind of code to make the program
longer while adding significantly less work which was nice. I added the output that shows the input that the user
enters in the first image.
