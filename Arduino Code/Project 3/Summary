I did not have very many parts that I could use except for a few capacitors, a few wires, and more buttons and LEDs. I decided to add one more 
LED to the group. So there are three LEDs and 3 buttons. The buttons are off at the start but if you press any button it will make the respective
LED flash. I looked at this as the lights are three different playlists and each one is a different genre. You choose which playlist you want by
hitting whatever button makes the correct light turn on.
