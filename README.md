# Simplifying-Spotify-Project
This was a semester-long side project I did for my Computer Architecture class. Foundationally I wanted to mimick an app where you manage the music you listen to, I planned on simplifying the way someone would listen to music. When we listen to music we all have a list of criteria that we look for and all the criteria we quickly think of decide whether or not we like a specific song. I used three generic categories genre, length, and whether we want to add it to a playlist or not. This project involved three main projects, and within each main project, we had to figure out how to complete the assignment in three different ways. Each main project along with all its parts has its own files. A very brief summary of each project is listed below.

1. Digital Logics project
   - This was an introduction project using logic gates
2. Assembly Language Coding project
   - This was a project where we used the MARS MIPS program to practice assembly language coding
3. Arduino Uno Cyber-Physical project
   - This was a project where we practiced using Arduino Uno and a breadboard to help enhance our Arduino coding skills
