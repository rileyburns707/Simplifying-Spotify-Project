# Simplifying-Spotify-Project
This was a semester long side project I did for my Computure Architecture class. For my project I planned on simplifying the way someone would listen to music. When we listen to music we all have a list of criteria that we look for and all the factors we quickly think of decide whether or not we like a specific song. I used three generic categories of genre, length, and whether we want to add it to a playlist or not. This project involved three main projetcs, and within each main project we had to perform our tasks three different ways. Each main project along with all its parts have their own files. A very brief summary of each project is listed below.

1. Digital Logics project
   - This was an introduction project using logic gates
3. Assembly Language Coding project
   - This was a project where we used the MARS MIPS program to practice assembly language coding
5. Arduino Uno Cyber-Physicial project
   - This was a project where we practiced using Arduino Uno and a breadboard to help enhance our Arduino coding skills
